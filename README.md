# rl-bee-multimodal-sensing
Neuromatch group project: Relevance of sensory modalities for spatial navigation in foraging behaviours of the bee

Implemented features: 
1. logging, early stopping, model managment
2. model re-training
3. walls/obstacles

## TODO model wise:
1. Testing different architectures
2. Make goal smaller
3. Reward testing 
   1. Adding senses
   2. Time passed punishment
   3. wall hitting punishment
4. Increasing/gradually shrinking the goal size whilst training
5. multiple goals
